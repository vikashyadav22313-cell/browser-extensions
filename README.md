## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned how to:

- Manage component state effectively using `useState`
- Filter lists based on user interactions without mutating the original data
- Use controlled inputs for toggle switches
- Maintain UI consistency without reordering original data

### Continued development

In the future, Iâ€™d like to:

- Add search functionality
- Persist state using `localStorage`
- Add undo functionality for deleted extensions
- Add animations when toggling or deleting extensions

### Useful resources
